TAB shows a wildmenu (:set wildmenu) for the possible completion of the command.

- 5 - Deleting, Yanking and Putting
Cut, Copy and Paste in vim are called Kill, Yank and Put.
Killing and yanking are operations stored in various types of registers:
1. Unnamed register
2. Numbered registers
3. Named registers
4. Black Hole register.

Registers are prefixed with "
Unnamed register: ""
Numbered registers: "0, "1, "2, etc.
Named registers: "a, "b, etc. (there are 26, from a to z)
Blackhole register: "_

"" contains text from the operations d, c, s, x, and y.
"0 holds the last yanked text (y)
"1 holds the last deleted (d) or changed (c) text.
Subsequent numbered registers shift with each d or c operation.
"_ the blackhole register stores text on demand without affecting other registers.

The d series of commands do not delete text physically. They kill the text instead.
For example, dd will kill the whole line and puts the line inside the unnamed register and in "1 register.

:reg (Inspect the content of the registers)
:reg 14 (Shows the content of registers "1 and "4)
u (Undo the last command)
CTRL-r (Redo the last command)
y (Yank text. This command accepts all previous variations od the 'd' command, yw, yy, etc).
p (Put (paste) the killed or yanked text in the line under the cursor)
P (Put the killed or yanked text in the line above the cursor)
"r d [y] (Kill or yank text in the specified register r)
"n p (Put the text stored in the register n)
"a y (Yank text in the named register a
"A y (Yank other text appending it in the named register a)

- 6 - Transforming and substituting text
I (Move the cursor to the first non-blank character of a line and enters insert mode)
a (Open insert mode at the right of the cursor)
A (Goes to the end of the line and enters insert mode)
o (Insert a new line and enter insert mode)
O (Insert a new line above the line and enters insert mode)
[n]i text ESC (Repeats the insertion command for n times, eg. 80i * ESC produces a line with 80 stars)
R (Enters replace mode. Everything inserted will substitute the text under the cursor)
r (Enters replace mode to substitute just one carachter and goes back to normal mode immediately)
cw (Change mode for a word, deletes the word and enters insert mode for substitution)
"r cw (Saves the deleted text in a named register r)
c$ (Like before, but replaces all the text from the cursor to the end)
cc (Like before, but applys to the whole line)
~ (swap a character at the right of the cursor from lowercase to uppercase and viceversa)
g~w (swap characters from lowercase to uppercase for a whole word)
g~~ (swap characters from lowercase to uppercase for a whole line)
g~$ (swap characters form lowercase to uppercase for the whole line from the current cursor position)
gUw (force all characters uppercase for a word, regardless of the capitalization)
gU$ (force all characters uppercase for a whole line, regardless of the capitalization)
guw (force all characters lowercase for a word, regardless of the capitalization)
gu$ (force all characters lowercase for w whole line, regardless of the capitalization)
J (Joins two consecutive lines. It appends spaces intelligently)
[n]J (Joins n consecutive strings appending a space for each joined line)
gJ (Joins two consecutive lines without appending spaces)

   -- Search, Find and Replace 1
f c (In a line, search for the first occurrence of the character c. Repeat the same search along the line with :, in the opposite direction with ,)
F c (In a line, back-search for the first occurrence of the character c. Repeat with : while repeating in the opposite direction with , )
t c (In a line, search for the first occurrence of a character and position the cursor on the character before it)
T c (In a line, back-search for the first occurrence of the character c.)
dtw (Search commands are motions, they can be concatenated with other commands. This deletes all the characters from the cursor to the first occurrence of w)
/word (Search the whole file for the word word. Repeat the search with 'n')
:set is [nois] or [is?] to see if active (Enables or disables incremental search. When starting a search, characters are highlighter)
:set hls [nohls] or [hls?] to see if active (Enables or disables highlight search. When enabled, all the searches in the page are highlighted)
/word ENTER, command (eg. cw and the text to replace) ESC (to search for a work, execute a command, then press 'n' to go the next search and press . to repeat the command. N search for the reverse order)
?word (back-search for a word, 'n' to repeat the search, N to reverse the order)
* (keep pressing asterisk) (Search for the word under the cursor, n to repeat the command and continuing searching)
# (keep pressing #) (Back-search for the word under the cursor, n to repeat the command, N to reverse the order)

   -- Search, Find and Replace 2
:s/old/new/ (Substitute old with new in the linei, only first occurrence)
:s/old/new/[flags] (with flag g, all occurrence in the line will be substituted)
:[range]s/old/new/[flags] (A range is one or more lines, separated by a , or ; The simplest range is a line number)
:1s/is/isn't/g (Will substitute all occurrences of is with isn't on line 1)
:1,5s/for/FOR/g (Will substitute all occurrences of for with FOR in the first 5 lines)
Other range symbols are:
. --> Current line
$ --> Last line
% --> All lines (entire file)
.,$s/old/new/g (Substitute all occurrences of old with new from the current line to the end)
:/Global/,/Local/s/net/org/g (In the range from the line containing the word Global to the word Local, substitute all occurs of net with org)
:/Global/,$s/net/org/g (From the line containing Global to the end of the file, substitute all occurs of net with org)
In order to substitute words containing characters that are also part of the command, we need to quote them. For example:
to substitute /var/spool with /usr/local:
:s/\/var\/spool/\/usr\/local/
There is an easier way: using another symbol as the character separator, for example the character # (others can be used, like +, |, etc)
:s#/var/spool#/usr/local# (Substitute /var/spool with /usr/local, using a different character separator)
:set nu [nonu] [nu!] [nu?] (Set line numbers in the editor)

- 7 - Text Objects and Macros
   
   -- Text Objects
When operating with text objects, the command operate on the entire object regardless of the cursor position.
daw (delete a word - deletes an entire word, including the whitespace after it. Word in this case is considered a text object)
diw (delete inner word - deletes an entire word preserving the whitespace after it)
Patterns for text objects are:
  {operator}{a}{object}
  {operator}{i}{object}
a and i are punctuation and whitespaces delimited, A and I don't consider punctuation.
eg. daw (delete a word) or ciw (change inner word)
   
   -- Sentences and paragraph text objects
A sentence boundary is a period.
To delete full sentences, 'is' or 'as' are used in conjuction with the operator.
das (deletes a sentence)
dis (deletes an inner sentence preserving the whitespace at the end)

A paragraph boundary is a blank line.
To delete full paragraph, 'ap' or 'ip' are used in conjunction with the operator.
dap (deletes a paragraph)
dip (deletes an inner paragraph preserving the whitespace at the end)
   
   -- Custom text objects
In programming languages, delimiters for text are of various types.
It can be specified after the 'a' or 'i' operator.

ca] (changes all the text enclosed between [ and ], including the brackets)
ci] (changes all the text enclosed between [ and ], preserving the brackets which are the boundaries)
da) or dab (changes all the text enclosed between ( and ), including the brackets, also called blocks with the specific command dab)
di) or dib (changes all the text enclosed between ( and ), preserving the brackets, also called blocks with the specific command dib)
da} or daB (changes all the text enclosed between { and }, including the brackets, also called blocks with the specific command daB)
di} or diB (changes all the text enclosed between { and }, preserving the brackets, also called blocks with the specific command diB)
This series of commands also works with characters <>, "", '', `` 
b are blocks enclosed in round parentheses, B are blocks enclosed in curly braces.

   -- Tag objects
In HTML for example, <p>text</p> constitutes tags. Vim has specific tag text objects, represented by the operator 't'.
Each text enclosed between angular brackets are considered tags in Vim.
dat (deletes all the text enclosed between two tags, including the tags)
dit (deletes all the text enclosed between two tags, preserving the tags)
